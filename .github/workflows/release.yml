            ## Something Crappy Theme ${{ github.ref_name }}

            Just download `userChrome.css` and throw it in your Zen profile's `chrome` folder.

            Check the [README](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/master/README.md) if you need help installing (it's pretty straightforward tho).

            ### What you get
            - userChrome.css (the whole theme in one file)
            - Gruvbox-ish dark colors (crappy creamy style)
            - 90% opacity urlbar that actually looks good
            - No background boxes anywhere (I use keyboard anyway)
            - Works great with Dark Reader

            ### Quick install
            1. Enable userChrome in about:config
            2. Drop this in `~/.zen/[your-profile]/chrome/userChrome.css`
            3. Restart Zen
            4. Done
